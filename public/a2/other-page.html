To practice using anchor tags, add the following example at the end of index.html. It creates two hyperlinks. One navigates to lipsum.com, a website that contains dummy text, and the other link navigates to another document located in the same website. Create the other-page.html document in the same directory as index.html and fill it with some dummy text. Click the other page link and confirm the navigation works.
